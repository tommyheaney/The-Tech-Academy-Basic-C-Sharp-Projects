# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects

Welcome to my repository for C# and .NET Framework projects, part of my coursework at The Tech Academy. Here, you'll find a collection of projects and exercises that I've completed, showcasing my skills in C# development and .NET Framework.

## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive display of the various assignments and projects I've tackled throughout the C# and .NET Framework course. Each project is stored in its own directory, complete with source code, resources, and a dedicated README providing insights into the problem statement, my approach to solving it, and the concepts applied.

## Projects

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific project or exercise. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect to find:
